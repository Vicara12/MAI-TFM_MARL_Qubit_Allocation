    A problem instance is composed of a circuit_slice_gates tuple and a circuit_slice_matrices tuple.
    circuit_slice_gates is a tuple that contains a tuple for each time slice in the circuit. This
    time slice tuple is then made of another tuple per gate in that time slice, which contains the
    index (starting from 0) of the two qubits that form the gate.

    Returns:
